# Read H5AD in R


An R toolkit for reading `.h5ad` files and performing basic preprocessing for single-cell RNA-seq data.

This repository provides example scripts using both the `hdf5r` and `zellkonverter` packages to import and preprocess single-cell data stored in `.h5ad` format (commonly generated by Python's Scanpy). These scripts are particularly useful for users who wish to work with AnnData-formatted data in R.

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

Please make sure the following packages are installed:

```r
# For reading raw h5ad data
install.packages("hdf5r")

# For converting AnnData to SingleCellExperiment
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(c("zellkonverter", "SingleCellExperiment", "scater", "scran"))
